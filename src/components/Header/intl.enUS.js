    paragraph: `I'm a software developer generalist/specialist (Pi Shaped professional Profile), with hard knowledge in Javascript and Functional Programming, and generalist skills in backend Python, Java, Elixir, and Rust. Today I am studying system architecture for cloud-native applications with the intention of refining my skills like a full stack developer. In 2007 I had my first contact with development in RPG maker (i did modules for my games =D), after this in 2008 I started at the Information System College (UCP), and since then I work and study web development with frontend and backend in most products. My favorite languages today are Rust, elixir, and Typescript (Deno is lovely), and I  become an indispensable employee for any cloud-native product.`,
